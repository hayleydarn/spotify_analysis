Don't wanna see you by yourself, by yourself
By yourself, by yourself, by yourself

We on a drive, looped in
Two seat ride, couped in
Who gon' slide? Who's in?
Big rocks 'round, new tint
Fleetwood down, new sand
Two seat ride, couped in
Don't leave 'round loose ends
Don't be around new friends, yeah

Hit it, go downtown Sunday
Then move it uptown Monday

By yourself, by yourself, by yourself

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
If I give it to you, will you leave?
Tell it to you, will you speak?
Got it tatted on my sleeve
Fell in love overseas
Ass fatter than a peach, uh
Ocean water kinda deep, uh
Rollin' up out the reef, uh
Put me down, straight to sleep

[Refrain: Travis Scott & James Blake]
Lasting like Duracell
Lasting like Duracell
40 days, 40 nights
Feel like a holy night
The lesson's always there
That less is always more
And in the back and forth
I'm not keeping score
Lesson's always there
That less is always more
When you're alone with me
You never come up short
You never come up short
(Never come up short, never come up short, never come—)

[Verse 3: James Blake]
Watch the fan as it spins
In my arms, wrapped in
Don't know where you stop
And where I begin
Like I found myself an imaginary friend
And when we stay in
Not missin' anything

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
We just be mile high clubbin'
I'm on a thousand miles runnin'
Hit it, go downtown Sunday
Then move it uptown Monday

[Post-Chorus: James Blake]
Don't wanna see you by yourself, by yourself
By yourself, by yourself, by yourself

[Verse 4: James Blake]
Hi-Vis, never seen
Low-key as it's been
Fell in love overseas
Fell in love like it's easy
Put to sleep without dreams
Under the moonbeam
Call you for no reason
Hold on like it's greasy

[Refrain: Travis Scott, James Blake & Both]
Lasting like Duracell
Lasting like Duracell
40 days, 40 nights
Feel like a holy night
The lesson's always there
That less is always more
And in the back and forth
I'm not keeping score
Lesson's always there
That less is always more
When you're alone with me
You never come up short
You never come up short

20/20 vision, got you with precision
It would take more than 1 or 2
To get me so into you (I'm not in your eyes)
I'm pretty jaded and I didn't even say that (I want you)
When you hit me up, there's no reply
Once you're coming on, I go offline

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're the one that sent the message
I don't need you at my beck and call
What makes you so sure? (On and on)
When you're the one that instigated
I had not reciprocated, no
Writing's on the wall

And you wonder why I didn't come back
Don't wanna think twice on the contact
Another wild ride, another nightcap
I gave you one try

And you wonder why I didn't come back
Don't wanna think twice on the contact
Another wild ride, another nightcap
I gave you one try till you're making me your alibi

No disrespect, I just wanna keep it candid
Guessing we've got different standards, so low
I'm not feeling it, and thanks to my intuition
Got me dodging a collision at last

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You're the one that sent the message
I don't need you at my beck and call
What makes you so sure? One day
You're the one that sent the message
I reciprocated
No, ball's not in your court

And you wonder why I didn't come back
Don't wanna think twice on the contact
Another wild ride, another nightcap
I gave you one try

13,Loose Ends,Loyle Carner,"

[Chorus: Jorja Smith & Loyle Carner]
In love, when the going is tough
I wait 'til it falls on deaf ears
Hearsay, without the boundaries of love
My take is, I wish there was a better way
Uh, I got a lot of love, a lot of loose ends (Way)
A lot of people that I wish I knew then (Way)
Friends beckon every second you spend (Way)
I'm wettin' the pen, every letter you send
Uh, I got a lot of love, a lot of loose ends (Way)
A lot of people that I wish I knew then (Way)
Friends beckon every second you spend (Way)
I'm wettin' the pen, every letter you send

[Verse 1: Loyle Carner]
Yo, I been listening to Dreamy Days, I'm in disarray
I realise it's everybody else who's still astray
I feel ashamed, I know there ain't no savin' away
They went astray, I went Australia
So what I'm supposed to say to 'em?
Uh, when all this love's out of range
Everything around me changed, I'm supposed to stay the same
Turn down these free drinks I couldn't even name
And I like all this money, 'cause I'm fuckin' up my brain
I been goin' insane, shelf full of family remains
Brokenhearted is seein' none of them again
I, I pour the glass, stick my head out in the rain
Try and find another person I can blame
Sat upon this plane, uh
And yo, I'm prayin' that we don't crash
'Cause every night, I shiver at the sight when we go back
'Cause every night could be my last, and yeah, I know that
So I crack a smile 'fore it goes black, trust

[Chorus: Jorja Smith & Loyle Carner]
In love, when the going is tough
I wait 'til it falls on deaf ears
Hearsay, without the boundaries of love

A lot of people that I wish I knew then (Way)

[Verse 2: Loyle Carne]
Trust, uh, I wish you'd been there when my dad had died
Uh, I wish you'd been there when my mother cried
I, I wish you'd been there in the drag of night
To see my side, look me in my eyes when I was paralysed
And tell me everything's alright and push it to the side
It's just a sacrifice, at times, I told a bag of lies
But not a pack of lies, we always told a couple ones
Of course it was true, you only knew me from the dramatise
I feel an agonising risk, 'cause in a thousand islands
This is where I really wanna be when we were cracking wise
'Cause it was black and white, literally black and white
White from my mother and my father was the blackest skies
Skies, I, I can see it's true
I, I see my mother up in you
Shit, I think my dad'd see it too
Yo, I just wish he knew, uh

[Chorus: Jorja Smith & Loyle Carner]
In love, when the going is tough
I wait 'til it falls on deaf ears

A lot of people that I wish I knew then (Way)
Friends beckon every second you spend (Way)
I'm wettin' the pen, every letter you send

A lot of people that I wish I knew then (Way)
Friends beckon every second you spend (Way)
I'm wettin' the pen, every letter you send

[Verse 3: Loyle Carne]
Uh, imagine all the friends you see most
Each one you peggin' away
Is dependin' on you puttin' pen to the page, uh
And so, you break it down, checking they're paid
Another day you're heartbreakin', you resented the stage
You feel that same rage
Watch the crowd, watch the stage thinkin', ""Shit""
Rather in the crowd with your mates drinkin'
Misbehaviours, catch another dame winkin'
You feel ashamed, guzzle Jagers, your brain's sinkin'
You think it's deep, don't think it's depression
A misspent adolescence
But all this time, all this time, time's of the essence
You would never learn from your lessons
You're stuck in that same quintessence
Heartbreak, one in the same
Days change, but you're stuck in the game
It's like, she's tellin' you you're young enough to be at uni
Somehow, the one who sees through me

You can't go where I'm from
Your lips can lie
But your eyes can't hide, you were too young
You're too young

How I adore, our love would be so true
I just wish you knew
I'd be all yours if my mind didn't wander
I've got scars from a life before you

I just can't trust no one else
Please don't think I'm insecure

Or how far I've run
There's a reason why I can't apply all of me

36,Letter to Krept,Cadet,"

[Verse]
Yo, Dear Cuzzy
Real talk I don't even know how to start this
I just know that I love you
Anyway, let me talk cuzzy, let me be real
Let me tell you how a nigga feel from the dinner table, college or in the field
Let me get it out
Let me spill every emotion
But know it's going to be real
Do you remember how it used to be?
Casyo, Blaine, Cadet and Krept
Batty in bench, fam on the set
I would walk, you would walk
I would step, you would step
But shit ain't really feeling the same
That's the reason why I'm writing you
Because, really I just want my cousin back
I ain't got family that's as tight as you like
I didn't really know where to start
But college is kinda where the shit went pear
See, I found my wife in college
But I never made it into the second year
And I heard she was cheating
And I was tryna figure it out like it was Blue's Clues
But then, you were friends with the guy she was beating
I kinda felt like you let her get moved to
Cuz, I felt snaked
But I never said nothing, never opened my mouth
'Cause maybe, you never knew
You know you're my cousin, you get the benefit of the doubt
Now imagine how gassed Granddad would be
Seeing us on stage we were meant to be
But it hasn't been an easy road
Man it's been like chapters on the first one's jealousy
Well, maybe not jealousy
But that word should give you an idea of the truth
And true say, we be first cousins
When I say I do music yeah, always comparing a kid
Like everywhere I go, everybody saying something
Why don't he bring you in
Like a nigga did with Yungen
Got me bunning, got me feeling that the love is awful
And they all say I should have been on ""Paranormal""
Now around that time
I went from being Cadet to Krept's cousin
And see, yeah I was kicking myself 'cause I felt shit
But never said nothing
And like now we ain't spoken in months
And even advice I can't ask the kid
'Cause I remember your WhatsApp status saying don't chat to me if you're going to ask for shit
Now around this time everything's getting loose
Feels like with me you want nothing to do
See I'm taking bare digs
But everybody knew I was talking 'bout you in the like every single tune, I was bruised
Even though I felt one way, I would still love you to the death
Even got a bar, even though the love's oneway
I'd still bang you in your face if you're talking about Krept
But I guess the blame ain't on you
Because not once did I pick up the phone and phone you
I'm happy that you're doing your ting but it's a reminder of all the shit I don't do
So when your videos were hitting a mill
I was still taking bets up in William Hill
Now jealousy gone, 'cause it's dumb to feel
And the second chapter is where the hunger spills
See the second chapter's called hunger and this is where the shit gets peak
'Cause it's when I stopped watching you and I started watching me
But I still got your name in like every bar though
Parked up listening to Argy Fargo
And the one time you brought me to Wireless was exactly the kick I needed in the asshole
'Cause you chose me right over the mandem
Like even though we haven't spoke in long though
And wallahi after you send the invite
Thought you were going to say 'my bad, wrong convo'
'Cause then you brought me on stage
It was me, you and Killer Konan
I was the last one to come off stage
Well, 'cause up there, man it felt like home
And I swear since that moment
I took shit serious
Stopped shotting food, quit the moves
Quit the fraud and mandem thought I was delirious
See, I'd go carpark, write bars, leave the engine on
And then somehow fall asleep
Wake up with a dead battery
Get jump started, and then the same night
Go repeat, till the point now that I ain't even got a car
'Cause both the battery and engine's gone
But at least now I'm chasing my dream
I ain't felt like a wasteman in long
And the third chapter's called love
Ain't no soft shit, ain't no need for boohoo's
But when I started loving myself then I could love you like I used to
Got tired
I been a wasteman rapper I'm undercover in the crib
Man I got tired, I go into music events
Didn't recognise me for a thing
Man I got tired, I got tired
Of feeling like I ain't gonna win
And yeah I got tired, tired of telling you niggas that
I don't know why you don't wanna bring a nigga in see
I'm just glad I'm in the same race as you
And the dream is to go and share 1st place with you
You know man
You're my left lung and there ain't no replacing you
And P.S I'll still bang everybody in the face for you
Man, I love you
You must know this

Don't misunderstand me when I try to speak my mind
I'm only saying what's in my heart

Cupid doesn't lie
But you won't know unless you give it a try
Oh baby, true love won't lie
But we won't know unless we give it a try
Give it a try

[Verse 2]
Girl, when I ask you to trust me
That doesn't mean it that I'm gonna cheat on you
Cause I'm gonna never do anything to hurt you or mislead you
I love you

[Pre-Hook]
Baby, I'm so tired of the way you turn
My words into deception and lies
Don't misunderstand me when I try to speak my mind
I'm only saying what's in my heart

[Hook]
Cupid doesn't lie
But you won't know unless you give it a try
Oh baby, true love won't lie
But we won't know unless we give it a try

Ain't no doubt about it, Lord knows, I really mean it
I'd rather die before, before I lie to you
Never wanna leave ya, there ain't no life without you
Never gonna leave, never gonna go, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, oh

[Hook]
Cupid doesn't lie
But you won't know unless you give it a try
Oh baby, true love won't lie
But we won't know unless we give it a try

Walk with me

[Verse: Louis Rei]
21 before I got it done
Before I found a new perspective, beg you watch it
I been in and out them projects with some dodgy cunts
Couldn't tell me 'bout a profit 'less it's of a sum
Around the time, me and Konshens on and off on one
Way before the chains, watches, we was cocky
But I'd lie about my age in hopes of showing it proper done
Now I'm tryna take it where we wasn't from
To be honest, a lotta hate where I'm coming from
When you're honest and they hate where you're coming from
And if you're famous, then they aiming for the juggler
But they don't know the pain, just a cover, just
This for my, case strugglers
Don't say governments
Looking at a bird if the jakes tried ruffle us
It used to hurt then it changed into nothingness
Ten toes firm, I ain't playing with the shufflers
What, you think I'm out here rapping for the fun of it?
I got people relying on me, shit been real
Had to glide with the iron on me in the vig still
Could really have been over from the clip still
Harsh reality, after the academy
I winded down the wrong road
Evaded being a casualty
Then playing like it's casual
In actual it's agony
Post-traumatic stress, yeah
I've been battling with sanity
Saying for some women, I can see beneath the vanity
Need to highlight all the feelings you be having
Now, how am I supposed to love another being if I'm mad at me?
And why I'm going all out of the way for you to tap the screws?
Don't make sense, does it?
I would believe you and your friends, does it
We're over-flexing and then the next
So my advice is focus on your next subject
Better yourself and then the rest, of it
You get it? Shit
In the last three years
I learnt more about myself than I could ask for here
Hold this Remy, gas is how I mask these tears
And also secrets if you knew them, heh, listen
I used to roll a bunch of n****s
But last I hear
Kinda separated paths
But it's calm, I'm here
I'm just learning like you are, my n****
Throughout the journey I just seen
I can't advance in fear, heh
Hit me hard but at last, we're here
I've been working from the bottom like the concierge
En garde game on fleek, on God I swear
Couple tin man tried it but their heart weren't there
I'm just tryna make it out before my stance impaired
When it's all said and done
And then my voice is clear
I'm gonna say I was a master here
Shoutout to Morgs and them
Real rappers still at large, and it's
Become a pen-game challenge
Caused insane damage
I used to stress about it 'til I let fate have it
Started WSTRN season then the rest came catting
Behind the scenes, but I'm still achieving all this madness
Wouldn't believe how the police tried to ban us
CID following me, around the manor
When I got the kids with me, the piggies need to back up
Don't see it on the news but we're used to the harassment
I'm just tryna be about my business and establish
Fuck the status, sometime I wonder if it even matters
Only, listening to Lauryn Hill's 'Ex Factor'
Spoke to Ake on the phone, he said (""I wrote ten chapters"")
Keep at it, when you've touched road, don't go backwards
Don't take time for granted 'til you haven't got the access
Gotta keep it moving, things happen
Understand the universal law of yin-yang balance
Just imagine, seeing a n**** that you have beef with, imagine
You tryna level up and make peace, just imagine
You turn around, 'shoot people on the streets' shit
Not just him, his dad's on the scene, just imagine
Your mumma never raised you for no weak shit
Now you gotta double back for the remix
Imagine, imagine
Big man singing, now you're fighting for your freedom, imagine
New Lambo, we got the glow buzzing
And all them non-believers acting like they know suttin'
Talking 'bout our music's kinda grown on 'em
Centre of it all, I hear you know we sold London, just imagine
Overseas steezing with the mandem, get it cracking
It will work out if the whole team's active
West side riding like them Grove Street gangsters
See Js when you see me 'cuh I smoke trees, standard
It take the pain away, kinda feel that we pave the way
I ain't debating with no one, I'ma just say it straight
'Cause I'm a sensitive person so I be takin' pricks
See, when I came in this game, shh, I was like
I ain't feeling them people, I ain't feeling them
I don't believe in these people, I shouldn't speak to them
Don't identify as my equal, I don't need a friend
But then I seen all this evil, I had to look again
I ain't gon' lie and say, after I got signed
That I ain't never been a crook again
I gotta do this for the ones you got to [?]
Ain't no point in wasting this talent
Life's too short, I beg you take it and [?]
All this pain and this sadness
On my block, a couple doors down
A single mother with a small child
Took her life the other day and she was all smiles
They had a couple indiscrepancies, but sure
It weren't nuttin' big, more like
[?]
Now I'm at your door now
Now she's just getting buried in the floor now
My condolences to you and yours now

[Outro: Louis Rei]
I say that to say this
I stay thankful for this
From the plaques to the Brits
It don't seem real but it is
Alla' dat and the kids
Shoutout Am and to Ricks
Shoutout Jam and to Biz
Congrats to Kay and your kid
To my heart, and my rib
I'm a father for this
All my dargs in the mix
Keep it smart with the risks
Grab a seat and watch us take it to the top
Thanks for bearing with me 'cause I know I talk a lot

Mad

[Verse 1]
Back when me and Avelino used to make tracks
Live and die in the LDN in ends it's mad (Shit's crazy)
Trappers and a whole family in the same damn flat (Um)
Eve tryna get a salary while Adam out here
Licking shots to the cats, don't lack
Shubz on a Friday pulling up at Jbo's gaff (Skrt-ing, ay)
2-2 gyal getting moved by 2-2 man (2-2 man, ay)
Come off the decks if you can't mix its not happening (Nah)
More time gunshots in the air like bap bap bap bap (Mad)
Book smart with the bars but I never learnt that from school (Nah)
16 doing up radios sets I was spinning up all them fools
(Spinning em, spinning em, ay)
Times I would get home late to my mumzie's crib
""Simbi, who are you with?
What have you done?
Where have you been?""
Shit (Damn)
Tears in my eyes real tears when Ken got nicked (Ken got nabbed)
Tore everyone apart but the law don't give two shits
(Don't give two fucks)
Just another black boy in the system doing time in bin (True)
But he had a heart full of gold, good intent with a smile so big
Oh, he did, ay

[Chorus]
We used to have dreams of getting out the flats (Getting out the flats)
Playing PS2
Crash Bandicoot, Mortal Kombat (Know them ones)
I mastered my flow like Dizzee and Busta (Legends)
And one day buy real weed from a Rasta (Real Rasta man)

[Verse 2]
Slicking down baby hairs way before Insta (Way before Insta)
Time when I had a dummy on my chain
All for one likkle pose in a picture (Snap snap, ay)
Year 11 when I started putting the trees in Rizla (Smoke, smoke)
And to the niggas that fell off in this ting, no, we don't miss ya
No, we don't
But sometimes you have to go missing (Missing, missing)
Need a way out I was hoping, praying and wishing (Praying and wishing)
Now I'm doing up some mad tings, doing up big tings
Still I'm in ends when I pass through junior's plain ready on sight
When I walk in Wayne shouts out ""Yo, wagwan, sistren""
Kill 'em with flows
One by one or I kill 'em in bulk
Simz is the only one on her job
It's bait everyone in London knows (Um)
But still they don't wanna give no props but life good when you Make this much dough
I'm laid back, I'm good, I'm easy
Old school, it was too damn easy

[Chorus]
Ina my Air Force one new era hat (Era hat)
Playing PS2
Crash Bandicoot, Mortal Kombat (Mortal Kombat, old school)
Used to bump train and dip the conductor
Now I can buy
Whole heapa ting from a Rasta (Bare tings)
We used to have dreams of getting out the flats (Ooo we did, we did)
Bus rides to the studio just to make tracks (EC1 days)
I mastered my flow like Luda and Kano (True)
Ask Lou and Reece and them man trust me they know (Trust me they know, they know, they know)
