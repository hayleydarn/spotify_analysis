5,Mile High (feat. Travis Scott & Metro Boomin),James Blake,"

[Intro: James Blake]
Don't wanna see you by yourself, by yourself
By yourself, by yourself, by yourself

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
We on a drive, looped in
Two seat ride, couped in
Who gon' slide? Who's in?
Big rocks 'round, new tint
Fleetwood down, new sand
Two seat ride, couped in
Don't leave 'round loose ends
Don't be around new friends, yeah

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
We just be mile high clubbin'
I'm on a thousand miles runnin'
Hit it, go downtown Sunday
Then move it uptown Monday

[Post-Chorus: James Blake]
Don't wanna see you by yourself, by yourself
By yourself, by yourself, by yourself

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
If I give it to you, will you leave?
Tell it to you, will you speak?
Got it tatted on my sleeve
Fell in love overseas
Ass fatter than a peach, uh
Ocean water kinda deep, uh
Rollin' up out the reef, uh
Put me down, straight to sleep

[Refrain: Travis Scott & James Blake]
Lasting like Duracell
Lasting like Duracell
40 days, 40 nights
Feel like a holy night
The lesson's always there
That less is always more
And in the back and forth
I'm not keeping score
Lesson's always there
That less is always more
When you're alone with me
You never come up short
You never come up short
(Never come up short, never come up short, never come—)

[Verse 3: James Blake]
Watch the fan as it spins
In my arms, wrapped in
Don't know where you stop
And where I begin
Like I found myself an imaginary friend
And when we stay in
Not missin' anything

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
We just be mile high clubbin'
I'm on a thousand miles runnin'
Hit it, go downtown Sunday
Then move it uptown Monday

[Post-Chorus: James Blake]
Don't wanna see you by yourself, by yourself
By yourself, by yourself, by yourself

[Verse 4: James Blake]
Hi-Vis, never seen
Low-key as it's been
Fell in love overseas
Fell in love like it's easy
Put to sleep without dreams
Under the moonbeam
Call you for no reason
Hold on like it's greasy

[Refrain: Travis Scott, James Blake & Both]
Lasting like Duracell
Lasting like Duracell
40 days, 40 nights
Feel like a holy night
The lesson's always there
That less is always more
And in the back and forth
I'm not keeping score
Lesson's always there
That less is always more
When you're alone with me
You never come up short
You never come up short
(Never come up short, never come up short, never come—)

20/20 vision, got you with precision
It would take more than 1 or 2
To get me so into you (I'm not in your eyes)
I'm pretty jaded and I didn't even say that (I want you)
When you hit me up, there's no reply
Once you're coming on, I go offline

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You're the one that sent the message
I don't need you at my beck and call
What makes you so sure? (On and on)
When you're the one that instigated
I had not reciprocated, no
Writing's on the wall

[Chorus]
And you wonder why I didn't come back
Don't wanna think twice on the contact
Another wild ride, another nightcap
I gave you one try

[Chorus]
And you wonder why I didn't come back
Don't wanna think twice on the contact
Another wild ride, another nightcap
I gave you one try till you're making me your alibi

[Verse 2]
No disrespect, I just wanna keep it candid
Guessing we've got different standards, so low
I'm not feeling it, and thanks to my intuition
Got me dodging a collision at last

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You're the one that sent the message
I don't need you at my beck and call
What makes you so sure? One day
You're the one that sent the message
I reciprocated
No, ball's not in your court

[Chorus]
And you wonder why I didn't come back
Don't wanna think twice on the contact
Another wild ride, another nightcap
I gave you one try

[Chorus]
And you wonder why I didn't come back
Don't wanna think twice on the contact
Another wild ride, another nightcap
I gave you one try till you're making me your alibi

[Chorus]
And you wonder why I didn't come back
Don't wanna think twice on the contact
Another wild ride, another nightcap
I gave you one try

[Chorus]
And you wonder why I didn't come back
Don't wanna think twice on the contact (Wanna keep it candid)
Another wild ride, another nightcap
I gave you one try till you're making me your alibi

One time, one time, one try till I am your alibi

No time, no

[Verse 1: Dave]
Send me the location
This year ’bout vacations
Flight catching, train taking
Soon as my nigga off probation
Your boyfriend's on a waiting ting
Looking for one wish, on a Ray J ting
I pree'd that girl, outrageous ting
But she can’t see 'cause I got shades and ting
Bare girls wanna throw shade and ting
No shade, what shade is your foundation in?
Darkest grey, the shade I'm in
49 more if your babes wants in
I had me a famous ting
Goals and tings, gains and tings
My house party a babe station
Girls wanna chase, it's a status ting

Look, playboy, I don't need a Carti
I'm captain, I lead the army
Bad ratio, I leave the party
Three Somalis creepin' on me
Your ex wavy, we tsunami
Girl from India, sweet as naani
Head so good, now I speak Gujarati
You hardly, pardon me, I’m laughing again
I assisted, man, passed to my friend
Look, money like the alphabet
If you wanna see P’s, gotta pass on the ends
Came a long way from a park in the bends
To an '18 plate, man’s parking a Benz
Far from the rest but I'm far from my best
Life is a lesson, I'm passing a test
Yes, everyting blessed
I don't want drama and I don’t want stress
My girl got finesse, Caribbean flex
Body and chest, take buddy in chest
Thank God more, I grew up with less
Juss to the right, Rapz to the left
Rj in the middle, got Cee to the death
Batch full of dogs with the 60's vets

[Chorus: Burna Boy]
If you send me the location
Then I'll be right there
And make I come check you, my baby
No time, no
And my dawg is on probation

(Right now, right now, right now)
And all the games you play never stop right now
(Right now, right now, right now)

[Verse 3: Burna Boy]
I pull up on the block, I see everybody watching
'Cause there's diamonds on my chain
And there's diamonds on my watch
Money moves, Off-White shoes
Came straight from Virgil Abloh
I've been down, I've been low
Had my mattress on the floor
No map, North Cap, bend it up
Gyal a ring-ring my cellular
Mi 'ave big fat spliff pon me, nuh
Inna the big black Benz, pullin' up
Please tell everybody to start pulling up
'Nough champagne from the bar coming up
Party hard, make her live my life, oh

[Chorus: Jorja Smith & Loyle Carner]
In love, when the going is tough
I wait 'til it falls on deaf ears
Hearsay, without the boundaries of love
My take is, I wish there was a better way
Uh, I got a lot of love, a lot of loose ends (Way)
A lot of people that I wish I knew then (Way)
Friends beckon every second you spend (Way)
I'm wettin' the pen, every letter you send
Uh, I got a lot of love, a lot of loose ends (Way)
A lot of people that I wish I knew then (Way)
Friends beckon every second you spend (Way)
I'm wettin' the pen, every letter you send

[Verse 1: Loyle Carner]
Yo, I been listening to Dreamy Days, I'm in disarray
I realise it's everybody else who's still astray
I feel ashamed, I know there ain't no savin' away
They went astray, I went Australia
So what I'm supposed to say to 'em?
Uh, when all this love's out of range
Everything around me changed, I'm supposed to stay the same
Turn down these free drinks I couldn't even name
And I like all this money, 'cause I'm fuckin' up my brain
I been goin' insane, shelf full of family remains
Brokenhearted is seein' none of them again
I, I pour the glass, stick my head out in the rain
Try and find another person I can blame
Sat upon this plane, uh
And yo, I'm prayin' that we don't crash
'Cause every night, I shiver at the sight when we go back
'Cause every night could be my last, and yeah, I know that
So I crack a smile 'fore it goes black, trust

[Verse 2: Loyle Carne]
Trust, uh, I wish you'd been there when my dad had died
Uh, I wish you'd been there when my mother cried
I, I wish you'd been there in the drag of night
To see my side, look me in my eyes when I was paralysed
And tell me everything's alright and push it to the side
It's just a sacrifice, at times, I told a bag of lies
But not a pack of lies, we always told a couple ones
Of course it was true, you only knew me from the dramatise
I feel an agonising risk, 'cause in a thousand islands
This is where I really wanna be when we were cracking wise
'Cause it was black and white, literally black and white
White from my mother and my father was the blackest skies
Skies, I, I can see it's true
I, I see my mother up in you
Shit, I think my dad'd see it too
Yo, I just wish he knew, uh

[Verse 3: Loyle Carne]
Uh, imagine all the friends you see most
Each one you peggin' away
Is dependin' on you puttin' pen to the page, uh
And so, you break it down, checking they're paid
Another day you're heartbreakin', you resented the stage
You feel that same rage
Watch the crowd, watch the stage thinkin', ""Shit""
Rather in the crowd with your mates drinkin'
Misbehaviours, catch another dame winkin'
You feel ashamed, guzzle Jagers, your brain's sinkin'
You think it's deep, don't think it's depression
A misspent adolescence
But all this time, all this time, time's of the essence
You would never learn from your lessons
You're stuck in that same quintessence
Heartbreak, one in the same
Days change, but you're stuck in the game
It's like, she's tellin' you you're young enough to be at uni
Somehow, the one who sees through me

38,Psycho,Dave,"

[Intro]
Tuesday, 23rd of January, 2018
I'm here with David
This is our first session
We're just gonna talk about your background
Where you're from, any issues you've been dealing with
So, where should we start?

[Verse]
Look
Stop all the pain
How do you stop all the pain, huh?
I used to hear a voice when I was praying
But nowadays, I don't even wanna be saved
Nah, fuck that, I don't wanna be saved
I was born to be wild, I don't wanna be tamed
Talent's in my blood and I don't wanna be vain
But if I'm a psycho, then I don't wanna be sane
I used to dream of this shit when I was hopping on train
So, so bad, I used to want all the fame
My ex-girl want to shoot a cover for Vogue
Which is pretty ironic 'cause she's top of the range
If any one of you take a shot on a track
My niggas come back and put a shot in your frame
Easy as the alphabet
Three G's in the ring, call me Alvarez
My teacher used to say I need counseling
Couldn't stop asking me, ""What do you feel?""
There's so many old scars that they wanna reveal
We got off on the wrong foot 'cause I don't want him to heal, nah
But if you're looking for a psycho, you got one
I thought I had a screw loose but I lost one
Ninety-nine problems, money, it is not one
My currency's Kenyan, that's in it for the long run, huh
Tears on a pillow
Bro, I shed so many tears on a pillow
I used to tell my teachers that nobody gets it
I don't know Clarke but I know that I'm a Kidult
'Cause my mummy ain't been home, miss thinks I'm involved
Blame my environment, it made me a sicko
Furthermore, I should bring that bitch down to Streatham
And then make her spend a day in a veil like a widow
Kiddo, we seen swords longer than a limo
My bros are blacksmiths like Jaden and Willow
Man, there's weapons over here, we're reppin' over here
We're from the Southside but it's Streatham over here
No telling if you're selling, hold the wettin' over here
Get him over here, who the fuck is checkin' over here?
Most my niggas are the ones applying pressure over here
Fuck assault, I can get a nigga peppered over here, whoa
We wanted more, then some food on the strip or moving a brick
My niggas went to school with the rich and we were broke
Hiding crow in a Rubicon drink
Which is funny 'cause that's how we put food in the fridge
So, who am I?
Someone tryna live his best life
I just wanna take a pretty woman for a test drive
If I bring her to my room and I press, I
Guarantee she gonna see the force like an ex-wife
People tell me I'm a little bit barmy
For my army, I need a bottle of Bacardi
If it's me and a pouch with my dargy
Shawty, you're seeing two stars in the party
Fuck what you heard
I'm a top boy and I ain't giving man a turn
I don't wanna know a pretty woman wanna flirt
Learned you can judge a nigga by the women that he curves
I love this game, I ain't lost focus
I'm a hitmaker, if you haven't noticed
I could be the rapper with the message like you're hoping
But what's the point in me being the best if no one knows it?
Brother I'm a careful, humble, reckless, arrogant, extravagant
Nigga probably battlin' with manic depression
Man, I think I'm going mad again
It's like I'm happy for a second then I'm sad again
And to my fans, the reason I could get to this
You're my drug, the instrumental my therapist
Man, I need some therapy
My girl saying that she'll never leave
I'm scared she gonna find a better me
Deeper insecurities, like
What if I don't leave a legacy?
Money, why they check for me?
Mummy lost respect for me
I wish we could be together but that ain't how life works
I used to cry about my dad until my fucking eyes burnt
Nose running, you don't know nothing
Before I put a penny on the table, I provided for my family
Held my mother's hand through the agony, hey
You ever fall 'sleep 'cause you don't wanna be awake?
In a way, you're tired of the reality you face?
If you're thinking 'bout doing it
Suicide doesn't stop the pain, you're only moving it
Lives that you're ruining
Thoughts of a world without you in it, hiding
I ain't psycho but my life is

I am longing for you

Mad
Mad

[Verse 1]
Back when me and Avelino used to make tracks
Live and die in the LDN in ends it's mad (Shit's crazy)
Trappers and a whole family in the same damn flat (Um)
Eve tryna get a salary while Adam out here
Licking shots to the cats, don't lack
Shubz on a Friday pulling up at Jbo's gaff (Skrt-ing, ay)
2-2 gyal getting moved by 2-2 man (2-2 man, ay)
Come off the decks if you can't mix its not happening (Nah)
More time gunshots in the air like bap bap bap bap (Mad)
Book smart with the bars but I never learnt that from school (Nah)
16 doing up radios sets I was spinning up all them fools
(Spinning em, spinning em, ay)
Times I would get home late to my mumzie's crib
""Simbi, who are you with?
What have you done?
Where have you been?""
Shit (Damn)
Tears in my eyes real tears when Ken got nicked (Ken got nabbed)
Tore everyone apart but the law don't give two shits
(Don't give two fucks)
Just another black boy in the system doing time in bin (True)
But he had a heart full of gold, good intent with a smile so big
Oh, he did, ay

[Chorus]
We used to have dreams of getting out the flats (Getting out the flats)
Playing PS2
Crash Bandicoot, Mortal Kombat (Know them ones)
I mastered my flow like Dizzee and Busta (Legends)
And one day buy real weed from a Rasta (Real Rasta man)

[Verse 2]
Slicking down baby hairs way before Insta (Way before Insta)
Time when I had a dummy on my chain
All for one likkle pose in a picture (Snap snap, ay)
Year 11 when I started putting the trees in Rizla (Smoke, smoke)
And to the niggas that fell off in this ting, no, we don't miss ya
No, we don't
But sometimes you have to go missing (Missing, missing)
Need a way out I was hoping, praying and wishing (Praying and wishing)
Now I'm doing up some mad tings, doing up big tings
Still I'm in ends when I pass through junior's plain ready on sight
When I walk in Wayne shouts out ""Yo, wagwan, sistren""
Kill 'em with flows
One by one or I kill 'em in bulk
Simz is the only one on her job
It's bait everyone in London knows (Um)
But still they don't wanna give no props but life good when you Make this much dough
I'm laid back, I'm good, I'm easy
Old school, it was too damn easy

[Chorus]
Ina my Air Force one new era hat (Era hat)
Playing PS2
Crash Bandicoot, Mortal Kombat (Mortal Kombat, old school)
Used to bump train and dip the conductor
Now I can buy
Whole heapa ting from a Rasta (Bare tings)
We used to have dreams of getting out the flats (Ooo we did, we did)
Bus rides to the studio just to make tracks (EC1 days)
I mastered my flow like Luda and Kano (True)
Ask Lou and Reece and them man trust me they know (Trust me they know, they know, they know)

[Outro]
Listening to new sounds of Little Simz
Little Slimz
This is 101FM
Were live at ya
Top of the flats
Can't see us but you can hear us
We're loving it, you're loving it
Sweet as a fucking nut

Let me hear your heart beat
Let me feel your heart beat
Let me touch your heart beat
Cause I'm gonna change your heart beat

[Verse 1]
Children behave
That's what they say when we're together
And watch how you play
They don't understand
And so we're

[Pre-Chorus]
Running just as fast as we can
Holding on to one another's hand
Trying to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say

[Chorus]
I think we're alone now
There doesn't seem to be anyone around
I think we're alone now
The beating of our hearts is the only sound

[Verse 2]
Look at the way
We gotta hide what we're doing
Cause what would they say
If they ever knew
And so we're

[Pre-Chorus]
Running just as fast as we can
Holding on to one another's hand
Trying to get away into the night
And then you put your arms around me
And we tumble to the ground
And then you say

[Chorus: Cleo Sol]
I can't sleep at night
I don't wanna fight
My best friend is I
I'm so selfish
Guess I'm in denial
Maybe I'm wrong, you're right
Heard it all my life
I'm so selfish
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
I'm so selfish
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
I'm so selfish

[Verse 1: Little Simz]
Got a very big ego
Embedded in me that's the heritage ego
And land made, they ain't messing with the steeze, though
And now I'm here, can't entertain no bummy niggas
Need my nigga fresh in a tuxedo
Me and my new case, steady blowing weed smoke
I'm a woman who can teach you a little something about class (Class)
Diamonds will forever be a girls best friend (Friend)
Everything's imperative for the way I live
I know it's material, but not irrelevant
All this here is worked for, not inherited
Tell myself I write my niggas off but never did
Self loving
Need more self loving, that's how it goes
They wanna know you when your buzzing
But first things first, number one and priority
Call it what you want, doesn't phase
Doesn't bother me, honestly

[Chorus: Cleo Sol]
I can't sleep at night
I don't wanna fight
My best friend is I
I'm so selfish
Guess I'm in denial
Maybe I'm wrong, you're right
Heard it all my life
I'm so selfish
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
I'm so selfish
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
I'm so selfish

[Verse 2: Little Simz]
Love and hate can never be friends
Don't rush everything in this divine time
I peach, you couldn't handle a woman in my caliber
Had to let you mature like some fine wine, yeah
No validation, no applause
You don't have prove you got it when you know it's yours
I don't wanna feel disloyal for wanting to do me
Then you act brand new and I know the cause, wait
Call it what you like, 'til now I ain't ever been the selfish type
'Til now I ain't ever told nobody no, don't get it twisted
This shit didn't happen overnight
Still, if your life is amazing, what you got to fear?
Can't be concerned about what they're saying over there
I make it clear, don't be in and out about what you hear
You say I always get what I want and it isn't fair
But life isn't fair, go

[Chorus: Cleo Sol]
I can't sleep at night
I don't wanna fight
My best friend is I
I'm so selfish
Guess I'm in denial
Maybe I'm wrong, you're right
Heard it all my life
I'm so selfish
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
I'm so selfish
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
I'm so selfish
